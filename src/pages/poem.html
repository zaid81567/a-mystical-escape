          There's a strange memory, a strange story!<br />Where it starts and
          where it ends?<br />Where does this destiny take us?<br />Neither they
          understood nor I.<br /><br />Why does this smoke form when lights are
          switched on?<br />I dreamed of this, when I myself stay in
          delusions.<br /><br />Congrats! That you are someone's pride,<br />Being
          so close to someone, that went far away from everyone.<br />Carrying
          loads of love from everyone and settling into a new world.<br /><br />Whenever
          this evening will arrive, it will carry your thoughts the same way!<br /><br />A
          strange memory, a strange story.
